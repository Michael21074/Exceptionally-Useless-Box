There is only a rough guide for setting this thing up, and it's from the project report that was generated for this. Look at Documentation/MECH-457, Project Report, Reduced. I will upload a better schematic and assembly guide later on as time permits.

To-Do:
1. Upload schematic after drawing in Eagle/KiCad
2. Create a BOM
3. Upload a guide on assembly
